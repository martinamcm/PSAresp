## Description
PSAresp is a Shiny app which can be used to implement efficient analysis of PSA response. The PSA data is analysed using:
* Binary Method: Uses patients' binary response indicator 
* Augmented Method: Uses patients' continuous PSA data 

The tutorial below uses an example dataset to provide step-by-step guidance for using the PSAresp Shiny app. 

In the case that further queries arise about the functionality of the app for specific applications, contact Martina McMenamin at <martina.mcmenamin@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>.

## Getting started

To access the PSAresp GUI, go to https://martinamcm.shinyapps.io/psaresp/. 

An example dataset is available in the repository.

## Tutorial

The user begins by uploading a csv file containing a single column with the % change from baseline in PSA scores. A waterfall plot displays the data as shown below.

</p>

In the 'Analysis' panel, the user sets the response threshold for % change in PSA and a point at which to truncate PSA scores. For instance if the truncation point is 100%, all PSA scores above this value will be replaced by 100.

Note that changing the truncation point changes the results for the augmented approach but not the binary approach.

Clicking the 'Download Report' button will generate a pdf file containing the results.
